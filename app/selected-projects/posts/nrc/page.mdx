# Nike Run Club

As the everyday companion for millions of runners, Nike Run Club stands for more than just tracking miles—it’s about coaching, community, and progress. To deepen that connection, Nike launched Tips in Stride, a content series designed to bring the wisdom of its coaches directly to the running community.
\
\
The initiative spotlights 14 stories from North America’s Nike Run Club Coaches, each offering personal insights, expert guidance, and practical education to help runners at every level go further—physically and mentally.
\
\
Our goal was to create a cohesive identity and content framework that celebrated each coach’s individuality while uniting the series under a single Nike Run ethos. Through authentic storytelling, elevated visuals, and a consistent editorial rhythm, we transformed training advice into human connection—turning expertise into empowerment. 
\
\
The result is a series that moves beyond instruction to inspiration, embodying Nike’s belief that every run—no matter the distance—is a chance to grow, learn, and take the next stride forward.
