New Realities Project Features 10 Groundbreaking Young Women Changing the World Championed by United Nations Foundation Initiative Girl Up and Filmmaker Ava DuVernay.
\
\
The drivers of real change in the 21st century are young and female. Against the odds – and not before time – young women are leading the conversation around the burning issues of today. On education, poverty, social justice, technological literacy, and equality, their voices are rising up all around the planet and demanding to be heard.
\
\
At its core, the art direction embraced the idea of perspective. The goal was not only to showcase these voices but to immerse viewers within them — transforming empathy into action. The visuals became an extension of their stories: bold yet grounded, emotional yet optimistic, global yet deeply personal.
\
\
By blending cinematic storytelling with immersive VR design, New Realities delivered more than a campaign — it became a window into the future of representation, where young women are not just participants in change, but the architects of it.
