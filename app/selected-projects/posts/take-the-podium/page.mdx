# Take the Podium

<section className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 my-8">
  <div className="bg-[rgba(255,255,255,0.05)]">
In 2019, Take the Podium emerged as a powerful original series and social campaign, shining a light on clean athletes finally receiving the Olympic medals they earned—after years of waiting due to the disqualification of competitors caught doping. This movement was born from a landmark moment in May 2018, when the IOC committed to a new reallocation process, setting the stage for a wave of medal ceremonies across the globe throughout 2019.
\
\
Our mission was to craft a visual identity and narrative framework that honored the athletes’ resilience and the profound significance of their delayed victories. This system needed to carry the weight of justice restored, while celebrating the spirit of perseverance and integrity at the heart of sport.
\
\
Our approach: tell stories that resonate beyond the podium. Through a combination of cinematic visuals, authentic storytelling, and bold graphic elements, we created a platform that elevates these moments from mere ceremony to a profound reckoning.
