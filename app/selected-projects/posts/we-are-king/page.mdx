# We Are King

New York City has long been a proving ground for talent, grit, and ambition—and no team embodies that spirit quite like Martin Luther King Jr. High School’s soccer program. Built from the city’s most resilient neighborhoods, this powerhouse team is made up of players from immigrant families and underserved communities, united by the game and driven by something deeper.
\
\
We were brought in to develop a visual identity for a six-part original series spotlighting this extraordinary team—not just to capture their dominance on the field, but to reflect the rich cultural fabric that defines their story. The identity needed to carry the energy of the city, the emotion of the players’ journeys, and the impact of soccer as a force for community.
\
\
Our approach: tell a story as bold as the city it was born in. Through a fusion of visual language, typographic character, and cultural references, we created a system that celebrates soccer not just as a sport—but as a vehicle for belonging, pride, and opportunity.
\
\
The tone of voice strikes a balance between raw and uplifting. It mirrors the realness of the players’ lives while celebrating the unbreakable optimism that defines their team spirit. It’s not just about wins—it’s about the will to rise, again and again.
\
\
This is more than a series about soccer. It’s a story about New York. About family, ambition, and what happens when you give talent a stage and community a spotlight.
